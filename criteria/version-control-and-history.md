## Requirements

### The community MUST have a way to maintain version control for the code.

Git is great.

See a list of git options under [All source code for any policy and software in use (unless used for fraud detection) MUST be published and publicly accessible.](#All-source-code-for-any-policy-and-software-in-use-unless-used-for-fraud-detection-MUST-be-published-and-publicly-accessible)

#### Resources

* [Producing OSS: Version Control Vocabulary](https://producingoss.com/en/vc.html#vc-vocabulary) by Karl Fogel.
* [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) by GitHub for learning how to use it or refresh your skills.
* [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) by GitHub, a list with the most common used git commands.

### All files in a codebase MUST be version controlled.

### All decisions MUST be documented in commit messages.

### Every commit message MUST link to discussions and issues wherever possible.

### The codebase SHOULD be maintained in a distributed version control system.

Git is great.

### Contributors SHOULD group relevant changes in commits.

### Maintainers SHOULD mark released versions of the codebase, for example using revision tags or textual labels.

#### Examples

* [Mosip Registration releases](https://github.com/mosip/registration/releases)

### Contributors SHOULD prefer file formats where the changes within the files can be easily viewed and understood in the version control system.

<!-- Make a list of preferred file formats -->

### Contributors MAY sign their commits and provide an email address, so that future contributors are able to contact past contributors with questions about their work.
