# Welcome contributors [![This criterion in the Standard for Public Code](../assets/link-symbol.png)](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/welcome-contributors.html)

## Requirements

### The codebase MUST allow anyone to submit suggestions for changes to the codebase.

#### Examples

* GitHub pull requests like [https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pulls](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/pulls)
* [Self-hosted Gitea pull requests](https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/pulls)
* (add a good gitlab example)

### The codebase MUST include contribution guidelines explaining what kinds of contributions are welcome and how contributors can get involved, for example in a CONTRIBUTING file.

#### Resources

* [Instructions for adding a CONTRIBUTING file on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors)

#### Examples

* [OpenZaak CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [OpenGovernment CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Git CodingGuidelines](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines) is an example of a mature codebase with extensive guidelines
* [Template for gemeente Amsterdam](https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

<!-- Possible generic template here? -->

### The codebase MUST document the governance of the codebase, contributions and its community, for example in a GOVERNANCE file.

#### Examples

* [OpenRefine GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md), example of a fairly mature governance structure

#### Tools

* [Simple template for GOVERNANCE file](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/supporting-codebase-governance/governance-template.html)
* The [Governance game](https://governancegame.publiccode.net/) is a tool that help communities explore their needs of governance.
* [CommunityRule](https://communityrule.info/) is a governance toolkit to create governance files based on templates of common types of governance.

#### Further reading

* [The Good Governance Initiative](https://ospo-alliance.org/ggi/) by the OSPO Alliance has a handbook for building governance.
* [Best Practices for the Governance of Digital Public Goods](https://ash.harvard.edu/publications/best-practices-governance-digital-public-goods) by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation contains a playbook of different pracitces to implement in the governance along with case studies.
* [Organization & Structure of Open Source Software Development Initiatives](https://web.archive.org/web/20220526100844/https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/files/2017/03/2017-03_governance-FINAL.pdf) by Cyberlaw Clinic has a good overview of different governance models.
* [Governance of open source software: state of the art](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10997-007-9022-9) is an academic article on governance and might be useful for someone that needs solid arguments for their decisions.
* [IEEE Open Source Maintainers Manual](https://opensource.ieee.org/community/manual/) by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers can provide some inspiration as it provides the policies, guidelines, advice, and requirements for project leads, maintainers, contributors and other participants involved in IEEE Open Source projects.

### The contribution guidelines SHOULD document who is expected to cover the costs of reviewing contributions.

### The codebase SHOULD advertise the committed engagement of involved organizations in the development and maintenance.

#### Examples

* [OS2 Rollekatalog](https://os2.eu/produkt/os2rollekatalog) (in Danish)
* [CKAN (see the footer)](https://ckan.org/)
* [MasterPortal](https://www.masterportal.org/maintainer-group-en.html)

### The codebase SHOULD have a publicly available roadmap.

This could also be solved by having public task boards/kanban boards with suitable columns and issues/stories at high level (sometimes called Epics).

#### Examples

* [Notify roadmap](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features/roadmap)
* [Simple template for technical roadmap](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/supporting-codebase-governance/technical-roadmap-template.html)

### The codebase SHOULD publish codebase activity statistics.

#### Examples

* [GitHub Insights - Contributors](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/graphs/contributors)

### Including a code of conduct for contributors in the codebase is OPTIONAL.

#### Examples

* [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is a code of conduct with a set of core values and norms that are essential in a just and equitable software commons. It can be adapted to include the special shared values and norms particular to your own community and its members.
